Movement.

Keyboard / controller.
up/down/left/right
chords: up+right, up+left, down+right, down+left

movement should be in world space,
however the directions should align with the screen, even if the world is rotated 45 degrees or whatever.

thus movement should follow the terrain / stairs / whatever, but left should go left on the screen,
up should go up on the screen, etc., with speed on the screen depending on the direction because of the oblique view angle.

therefore the primary movement direction vectors in world space should be precomputed:

moveRight = <normalized(screenToWorld(<1, 0, 0>).xy) * moveSpeed, 0>
moveLeft = -moveRight
moveUp = <normalized(screenToWorld(<0, 1, 0>).xy) * moveSpeed, 0>
moveDown = -moveUp

moveUpRight = <normalized(screenToWorld(<1,1,0>).xy) * moveSpeed, 0>
moveDownLeft = -moveUpRight
moveDownRight = <normalized(screenToWorld(<1,-1,0>).xy) * moveSpeed, 0>
moveUpLeft = -moveDownRight
