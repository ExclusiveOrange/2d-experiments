As of 2022.06.06, MSVC cl.exe is not a suitable compiler for this project.
The reason is that MSVC cl.exe generates compile errors for simple, valid concepts, whereas clang-cl.exe does not.
I don't know why and I don't care, because it is simple to useWith g++ or clang-cl or clang instead of cl.exe.

In CLion:

File / Settings / Build, Execution, Deployment / Toolchains
    Visual Studio
        CMake
            C Compiler -> <some path>/clang-cl.exe
            C++ Compiler -> <some path>/clang-cl.exe
