CpuImageWithDepth versus CpuSparseImageWithDepth

on 9700k
with an image of a tile that is perhaps 2/3 empty
drawSparseWithDepth is about 30% faster than drawWithDepth

on Apple M1
drawSparseWithDepth is about the same speed as drawWithDepth

perhaps M1 is more sensitive to the extra memory lookups in sparse drawing

it is difficult to improve the performance without adding additional steps
because the memory can't easily be pre-fetched when it isn't known what memory should be pre-fetched

it may ultimately be best to not use sparse images at all,
but instead try to optimize rendering to use SIMD instructions to operate on several pixels at once
though there are alignment issues it may not matter on modern CPUs
